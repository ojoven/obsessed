We run a fintech company that requires quite a lot of capital and we always needed to rely on investors to support our business. When I started looking for investors, I found that finding angel investors and venture capitalists was extremely time consuming and hard. I would spend about 10 days to find 500 emails of VCs and Angels and manually put them one by one on my excel spreadsheet. After doing it for a while, I understood that there must be so many people out there who are having similar issues. So we created Investorhunt - a database of 40k+ investors which will save you hundreds of hours of research on AngelList, Crunchbase, and LinkedIn trying to find the right investors and their emails.

It’s astonishing how small things compound over time: \n\n* Reading 10 pages a day = 3600 pages a year = 14 books a year \n* Avoiding drinking a coke each day = 54k calories we skipped on a year \n* Writing 100 words per day = 36 blog posts per year \n\nI’ve always had trouble sticking to new habits. So I decided to build a chrome extension to track my progress and keep me on track.\n\n  \nIt was designed for me. So far I’ve made a ton of progress on my meditation, reading and working out habits.    \nAfter seeing my progress I decided to improve it so it can be used by anyone.\n\n  \nYou can try it on this website: [https://myhabits.co/](https://myhabits.co/) . If you like it you can follow the link at the bottom to install it on Chrome.\n\n  \nOne of my dreams is to become an entrepreneur. This is one of my first attempts.\n\n  \nYou can track up to 3 habits for free, if you want to track unlimited habits it only costs 1.25$ per month. This will help me keep the project alive, pay the servers, continue adding features and buy a cup of coffee every now and then.\n\n  \nI’d love to hear your feedback.  https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/8u8x1l/i_built_a_chrome_extension_to_track_my_habits/','https://www.reddit.com//r/SideProject/comments/8u8x1l/i_built_a_chrome_extension_to_track_my_habits/','self','https://i.redditmedia.com/HigArE012Pw0ehB4s9m54Rku6RqoWn2IZs8vixfEfcM.jpg?s=ff7ce3e4c9fbc200d9add3a5169eec1d',15,'2018-06-27 11:43:23'),(19,'8u7saa','reddit','SideProject','ishmooz : Classifieds for Slack teams',' https://www.ishmooz.com','https://www.reddit.com//r/SideProject/comments/8u7saa/ishmooz_classifieds_for_slack_teams/','default','https://i.redditmedia.com/HigArE012Pw0ehB4s9m54Rku6RqoWn2IZs8vixfEfcM.jpg?s=ff7ce3e4c9fbc200d9add3a5169eec1d',1,'2018-06-27 07:58:53'),(20,'8u6y2y','reddit','SideProject','Orions Comet',' http://www.orionscomet.com/','https://www.reddit.com//r/SideProject/comments/8u6y2y/orions_comet/','https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/c2fdKYDuL_2StYjEL8a8o3JXCGcvt63pG78oZ6YYkRk.jpg','https://i.redditmedia.com/F6AGihc6sjMmnVLm-XWIe0jcP2vPZpBwjOqH2PhZX-c.jpg?s=56a677929f9af56fa137ae07c36cfd15',0,'2018-06-27 05:14:35'),(21,'8u6lqi','reddit','SideProject','Mugatunes',' http://www.republic.co/mugatunes','https://www.reddit.com//r/SideProject/comments/8u6lqi/mugatunes/','https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/iwWccngFdRlW8lFkdwcPq-bebxY-td5_0H9KnqQ6BmU.jpg','https://i.redditmedia.com/OhPSAD5EOezMBytxVlmbVql-VaLki3brbskdSj2j0E0.jpg?s=9e473aba26236bd17626ec955405ca30',2,'2018-06-27 04:14:37'),(22,'8u5tns','reddit','SideProject','Notifee - The free notification service.','Hi everybody,\n\nhttps://nt.codfee.xyz/\n\nHere is my side project which I made at the free time, this is a service that provides to us a way to `notify the message` to your user (your blog, your side-project, internal app,...). \n\nLike me, I have some websites such as my blog, some side-projects... which I want to send a message to notify all of the users but I very lazy to implement one by one.
