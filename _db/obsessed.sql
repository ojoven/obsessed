From a customer-centric perspective, they want to see the full value they might get from your service before they chase the carrot.

They can see that MentorCruise does have a mentor that meets their needs, while still they have to register to get the whole enchilada.</p> <p>Option 1 might be worth testing if your primary conversion metric is bookings versus registrations (and maybe it should be). It removes an obstacle from the user’s fastest path of getting from the front page to giving you money.

So it depends on what your goal metrics are as well as what the sales funnel looks like.</p> <p>Option 3 doesn’t help much, since filters don’t represent the value your customer is after and restricting them artificially makes it harder to verify that MentorCruise has the value they are looking for.</p>  ','https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/4ed24add69?commentId=-LGhAwxvDMaiXlzT95jx',1,NULL,NULL,0,'2018-07-06 01:23:00'),(168,'x','4ed24add69',NULL,'scraper','indiehackers',NULL,'<p>That\'s some great feedback, thanks so much</p>  ','https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/4ed24add69?commentId=-LGhUl-YydABepmCfY-x',1,NULL,NULL,0,'2018-07-06 02:50:00'),(169,'YNvfKV','4ed24add69',NULL,'scraper','indiehackers',NULL,'<p>I could help with C# coding skills.</p> <p>I need help on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/ask-ih-looking-for-testers-on-reddit-what-would-you-improve-on-my-text-f1ae6cbd08\">https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/ask-ih-looking-for-testers-on-reddit-what-would-you-improve-on-my-text-f1ae6cbd08</a></p> <p>Thanks!</p>  ','https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/4ed24add69?commentId=-LGgPd5Fskgvz-YNvfKV',1,NULL,NULL,0,'2018-07-05 21:48:00'),(170,'LGgRkNm6WfGYQmfcpgW','4ed24add69',NULL,'scraper','indiehackers',NULL,'<p>I can\'t help you with C#, but maybe one of my mentors on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mentorcruise.com\">https://mentorcruise.com</a> can?</p> <p>As for the text, it\'s actually \'Redditors\', you might step on some feet writing that wrong (people will assume you only use Reddit to run ads).

We run a fintech company that requires quite a lot of capital and we always needed to rely on investors to support our business. When I started looking for investors, I found that finding angel investors and venture capitalists was extremely time consuming and hard. I would spend about 10 days to find 500 emails of VCs and Angels and manually put them one by one on my excel spreadsheet. After doing it for a while, I understood that there must be so many people out there who are having similar issues. So we created Investorhunt - a database of 40k+ investors which will save you hundreds of hours of research on AngelList, Crunchbase, and LinkedIn trying to find the right investors and their emails. Check us out and let us know what you think. ?  \n\n\n[https://investorhunt.co/](https://investorhunt.co/)  https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/8uwztk/a_database_of_40k_investors_to_raise_your_seed/','https://www.reddit.com//r/SideProject/comments/8uwztk/a_database_of_40k_investors_to_raise_your_seed/','self','https://i.redditmedia.com/AgKU1_lxmQ1LsvUHYKIVnf70m0BqokIkKxX8u1_S9Nk.jpg?s=b4179ab9d98824dae514381e4f457e07',10,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,'2018-06-29 21:48:39'),(2,1,'8uwcf1','reddit','SideProject','Update: Changed my service to a job search engine?

So, as there where many job board services, I thought of changing it to a job search engine. You simply add a job and location and it will search jobs from different job boards and display them.

Gaps to fill before applying to top 10s?','Hello everyone. I&#x27;ll be attending CMU at their Silicon Valley grad campus starting this August. Although I&#x27;m very excited to start preparing for the valley job search, I would like some advice on what gaps I should fill during my Master&#x27;s degree, either through coursework or in my own time.\nSome background: I completed a Computer Engineering degree at BU. It was heavily focused on C programming with architecture topics and microprocessor design, and all the other fundamentals such as Discrete Math and algorithms. Since I was able to complete my degree in 2 years, I have many gaps that I would like to fill through my graduate career. I will likely lean towards software since I lack the more technical knowledge of things like circuit design and pcb diagrams.<p>My knowledge from most familiar to least: C programming - Architecture Simulation such as cache design, branch prediction, INTEL PIN, assembly decompilation, recreated malloc<p>C++ algorithm design, search algorithms, some palindrome finding and optimization<p>Some work in C#, Java, and Python designing Unity games, other user oriented projects. However, I&#x27;m still lacking in this large scale system type projects and still not experienced with good hierarchy of parent and child classes, etc. Pretty much not as well touched up on the &quot;object&quot; side of object oriented programming.<p>Pretty much no real work experience, no cybersecurity knowledge, no machine learning knowledge, no database programming, no network type programming.<p>My current course plans for next sem are: Computer Systems (C programming, Assembly, architecture type programming); Project Based course (mixture of hardware and software); Internet Security course; Energy Aware computing (gives more depth of CPU components and how to optimize them for energy);<p>And my possibly course load for next semester: Fundamentals of software engineering (project based, industry type projects); Machine learning; Wireless networks; TBD','https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17441415',NULL,NULL,1,4,NULL,NULL,0,'2018-07-02 13:27:27'),(115,1,'17434699','hackernews','side+project','HomeworkApp: a server-sided application for pupils and students','&quot;Hello world&quot;,\nthat is the first thing you see when starting a new android studio project.\nNearly one year ago I came up with an incredible idea.

We&#x27;ve built a corporate credit card for startups that has high limits, an instant online application and no personal guarantees.<p>Pedro and I built our first payments business in Brazil, Pagar.me, when we were teenagers. We came to the U.S. to attend Stanford. We joined YC W17 and realized quickly – even with a seed round in the millions – that we could not get a corporate credit card. We are Brazilian, young, and do not have U.S. credit. Even if we did have credit – we know that personally guaranteeing a credit card makes no sense for a business (more on that later).<p>In Brazil, we raised $300K initially (when we were 16) from an investor that was willing to take a chance on us. In Brazil, even though there are 200 million people, there is very little venture capital financing and limited startup infrastructure (accelerators, resources, technical talent, executives experienced with high growth). We knew that $300K was all we were getting, so we had to find a business that could be cash flow positive quickly. It was easier to do that accepting payments online (which naturally generates cash), but it was an operational challenge for sure. We were able to grow quickly in Brazil because we hit the market at the right time, as ecommerce was transitioning to online payments and because we, better than any of the foreign competitors, understood the nuance of Brazil. Specifically on that point, in Brazil the consumer has the option to pay for any card transaction in installments, and that requires a cash outflow for the merchant. Pagar.me figured out how to productize that best to the online market there.<p>When we got to the U.S., we assumed that the payments system here would be significantly more mature and sophisticated than it was in Brazil, however that was not the case. Particularly on the issuing side (banks extending credit cards), there has been very little innovation or using technology to innovate on features. That is how Brex was born. Over the past year we’ve been incubating and improving and just launched with an online self-signup that lets you get access to a virtual card in minutes. We waited to launch until we had this feature, as we know how much of a pain it is to go through the back and forth of online and paper-based applications. Brex underwrites by connecting directly with your bank account, which means we can offer higher limits than other cards, often 10x-20x more.<p>From a software perspective, we rebuilt all of the payments tech from scratch, which we learned how to do in our last business. Even then, to build Brex it was still grueling having to deal with the obscure regulations surrounding Know Your Customer (KYC), heavy oversight from banking partners, and complexities associated with interacting directly with Visa. In doing so, we built awesome features like instant virtual cards issued to you and your team and we solved something this time that has been bugging us forever – the fact that you can never tell what a credit card charge is on your statement! We changed the data to give you the actual merchant &#x2F; vendor and a link to the website. When we did this, we also realized we could do something really unique with receipts – because we know the actual vendor &#x2F; merchant, we can match any receipt sent to us via SMS or email to your transaction immediately. No need to save receipts or deal with other integrations that have a huge delay between matching a receipt to a transaction, we do it in real time.<p>Interestingly, from a technical standpoint, we did all this in Elixir. We thought it would be a good choice (and so far we are happy with our decision) because of the distributed nature of the systems that we built and we could rely on the Erlang VM to provide that infrastructure out-of-the-box. Our domain knowledge from Pagar.me allowed us to anticipate the system boundaries and therefore we could build our backend as a distributed system from day one. \nAnother unusual feature about the Brex launch is that we are launching relatively late in our history and with a pretty significant amount of capital from our Series B. We launched the business at YC, but based on our background with Pagar.me and that we were focused on payments again, we raised a ~$7M seed round in Spring 2017. That round was led by Ribbit Capital – which we liked given our connection to Micky there and their expertise in Fintech. YC Continuity led our Series B. In both rounds, for us, it’s all about the relationship with the partner and firm, and we have been huge beneficiaries of the YC ecosystem.<p>On a personal note, for us the non-personal guarantee aspect of our product is most salient. As I mentioned, we are foreign entrepreneurs who don’t have access to banking products in the U.S. It was demoralizing to come to the U.S. after being successful in Brazil and not be able to get a card – especially given how much activity, particularly online, requires a credit card. Personal guarantees mean an entrepreneur who has already taken a ton of risk has to further put their personal financials on the line, which even if the company pays on time, can hurt his or her credit.<p>One aspect of the product that we’d love HN feedback on is the signup flow. We gathered great feedback from our beta, and we waited to launch until we had an instant signup product. In financial services, signup flows have meaningfully more constraints than do many consumer signup flows – particularly compared to those with freemium models. For example, we need to collect business information to comply with regulations around anti-money laundering and Know Your Customer standards, as well as ensure the customer’s ability to pay and set up autopay. These constraints mean not only a longer signup flow, but also one that integrates many third party vendors to do compliance, fraud and credit checks. The more integrations and data to handle, the more edge cases we need to be able to support seamlessly. It took a ton of engineering effort to get here, plus a lot of time enhancing our compliance processes and credit framework. In light of those constraints, we’re specifically looking for user feedback on whether or not the flow feels logical, intuitive and simple – and if there are adjustments to the order, text or design that could improve the UI. But we&#x27;re interested to hear any of your ideas and experiences and discuss the Fintech space generally too.

We don\'t have to have people who work shit jobs. We don\'t have to. We just need to figure out how to restructure society, so everybody somehow or another plays a part, has something to contribute, has something to share. I mean, that\'s what a real society supposed to be like. I give you some coconuts, you give me some fish, you know, we make a deal. And you do it back and forth and left and right and when there\'s nothing to contribute, then you start looking at the president to get you jobs, \"we need jobs\", so instead of something to contribute, you just find something to do with your time and then it becomes about doing that more then about finding something to contribute.\n\nSo society gets wrapped around becoming a part of a machine. Society, instead of becoming a bunch of individuals that are expressing themselves in unique ways, and everybody sort-of borrows and shares and sells this and you sell that and we all sort of figure out how we can contribute in a society, we got sidetracked and diverted into these boxes that they call companies and corporations. And we got stuck into these containers, we call cubicles or offices, and we got forced into this system.\n\nSo our time instead of it being invested in making pottery, or fixing cars, or doing something where you have a passion or you have some sort of a connection to, instead of that, you have sold your life to sit in a box and work for a machine, an un-caring machine that demands productivity. It doesn\'t understand you, it doesn\'t want to understand you. It has a bunch of very strict things in order to keep the humor at a minimum in the office, just in case one of you fuckheads says some stupid sex-jokes, that gets them sued, and they have to give somebody a million dollars. So get it together and this is your life now: no natural behavior, everybody\'s is wearing clothes they don\'t want to wear, everybody\'s showing up doing something they don\'t want to do, they have no connection to. That\'s the problem with our society.\n\nAnd then what\'s the reward for all this stuff? Go ahead, go home and get a big TV. You go home and you get a shiny belt buckle. You gonna get a nice purse. You gonna get shoes that you couldn\'t afford last week. You get that dream car. And every week we\'re chasing down this new object, and every week, we\'re trying to fill this hole, this sad shadow of a life that we\'ve been left with after work. That you work eight hours a day, plus commuting, and then you\'re like this. Sigh. Sigh.\n\nAnd that\'s your life. That\'s your real fucking life. All that other stuff is not your life anymore. All that other stuff is work. And most of us have committed to that. I know you (Brian Redban) have been in there before, and I know I\'ve been in there before. And we understand that it\'s a trap, because we got out of it. But for the people that are in it, a lot of times, they don\'t even understand it\'s a trap. They just think it\'s a good job. They think they\'ve got dental. \"I\'m doing really good, I\'ve got my own parking spot that\'s got my name on it\".

I also founded Remote OK (http://remoteok.io/), the biggest remote jobs board in the world. \n\nAfter I was quickly going broke in 2014, I started building \"12 startups in 12 months\" which got a lot of attention and forced me to ship a new app every month. \n\nMost of those apps didn\'t become successful, but some did: Nomad List became a real startup with millions of monthly users, multiple acquisition offers, $15,000 to $25,000/month revenue in membership fees, while having a real cultural impact of getting tens of thousands of people to travel and work remotely. \n\nRemote OK started as a basic jobs board for remote workers, and grew out to now be the highest traffic generating remote careers platform with about $10,000 to $20,000/month revenue in job posts.\n\nI am also Product Hunt\'s Maker of the Year 2015 and 2017, winner of Product Hunt\'s Side Project of the Year 2017, currently the #4 most upvoted Product Hunt maker, got my apps multiple times to #1 on Hacker News and I was on the frontpage of Reddit twice (with Nomad List and Hoodmaps).\n\nI don\'t have the keys to success, so I can only tell you what worked for me. A few principles I hold is that I don\'t take external funding, I do everything myself, I mostly don\'t really hire, I automate a lot which means I have lots of robots working for me 24/7, I like transparency and I hate business bullshit. That means I share my revenue, share the problems I have and the successes when things do work.

At the end we have a functioning map that you can draw on with colors. \n\nRecorded: 2017-03-31 23h00\n\nMusic: https://soundcloud.com/rinsefm/swamp81300317','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q--QUbZ_258','https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q--QUbZ_258/hqdefault.jpg','https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q--QUbZ_258/hqdefault.jpg',97,18,'Pieter Levels',NULL,0,'2017-07-15 04:12:49'),(175,1,'whGnPQxpXVY','youtube','UCSw5U1MuzDED2Nvlx9m65-Q','Hong Kong Express - 上海 (Shanghai)','I was in Shanghai this September + October 2016, I shot some videos and put them together with Hong Kong Express\'s track about this city.

So what are you NOOBS? :P Use a VPN to USA to watch it then!\n\nIn this YouTube series, I show how I build a mini startup called http://hoodmaps.com from the first line of code to a functioning web app. This was recorded in April 2017. A few months later, in July 2017 I launched the final web app http://hoodmaps.com to the frontpage of Reddit, Product Hunt, Hacker News and Beta List and over 200,000 people used it and it\'s now gaining traction (and hopefully a business model later). It\'s interesting because it shows how to make a basic web app that can get successful by writing plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery) code. No frameworks, no bullshit. Enjoy!

This means that we don\'t want to have every specific GPS coordinate drawn, instead we want to have brush strokes referencing a bigger \"area\" (like 100 by 100 meters), instead of a specific GPS spot (1 by 1 meter). We do this by changing a GPS coordinate like (53.23437348, -4.2338447) to (53.234, -4.233) and (53.23, -4.233) and (53.2, -4.2) etc. Every decimal we removes, we get less specific data. By normalizing the specific data, we summarize the colors in an area, and only show the dominant value. So if most people say this neighborhood is tourist, we\'ll show that.\n\nFrom here it starts getting difficult because we\'re dealing with math and brush sizes and pure hell.
